# 2420 Assignment 2

## Distributing HTTP Traffic to Servers With Load Balancing

### Setup

This assignment will require several things to set up:
- VPC
- At least 2 Droplets
- Load Balancer
- Firewall (DigitalOcean Cloud Firewall)

**Create a VPC in Digital Ocean**

![step1_vpc](images/step1_vpc.png)

**Create two droplets in Digital Ocean**

When creating them, make sure to give them both the same tag, and that they use the VPC network you created. In this example, both droplets have the **Web** tag.

![step1_droplet_web_vpc](images/step1_droplet_web_vpc.png)
![step1_droplets](images/step1_droplets.png)

**Create a load balancer in Digital Ocean**

Make sure that the load balancer is connected to the two droplets by using the tag associated with the droplets. The IP of the load balancer address will be used to visit content from the droplet servers.

**Create a firewall in Digital Ocean**

Add an additional inbound rule for HTTP and make the source the load balancer that was created. Apply the firewall rules to the droplets by using the tag associated with the droplets.

Once you have completed all these steps, **your setup is complete.**

### Installing Web Servers

Once you have created regular users for each of your droplets, install a web server on **both of them**. In the context of this example, **Caddy** is being used. Make sure to not configure web servers yet.

Download the .tar.gz file for x86_64 of caddy by using the following command:
 ```bash
  wget https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/releases/download/v2.6.2/caddy_2.6.2_linux_amd64.tar.gz
  ```

You should see something similar to this appear once it's been downloaded, and the archived file should appear be in your server:

![step3_archivedCaddy](images/step3_archivedCaddy.png)

To extract the contents of the download, use the following command:

```bash
tar xvf caddy_2.6.2_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```

Once extracted, you should have a LICENSE, README.MD, and caddy in the location in which you extracted caddy:

![step3_unarchivedCaddy](images/step3_unarchivedCaddy.png)

Make sure to change the caddy fileâ€™s owner and group to root:

```bash
sudo chown root: caddy
```

Copy the caddy file to the bin directory:

```bash 
sudo cp caddy /usr/bin/ 
```
![step3_usrbincaddy](images/step3_usrbincaddy.png)

**Repeat all of these steps in your other droplet server.**

### Writing a web app

On your local machine (in WSL if you are on Windows) create a directory. In this example the directory is named `2420-assign-two`. Inside the directory, create 2 more directories called `html` and `src`:

```bash
mkdir 2420-assign-two
cd 2420-assign-two
mkdir html && mkdir src
```

![step4_assign-two-ls](images/step4_assign-two-ls.png)

Inside the `html` directory, create an index.html page. 

```bash
cd 2420-assign-two
cd html
vim index.html
```
In this example, the index.html page looks like this: 

![step4_html](images/step4_html.png)

Inside the `src` directory, create a new node project with the following command:

```bash
npm init
```

![step4_npm_init](images/step4_npm_init.png)

When prompted for package name, description, entry point, etc, press enter to skip or keep everything as default. 

Afterwards, install fastify:

```bash
npm i fastify
```

Output of the command will look like this:

![step4_npm_i_fastify](images/step4_npm_i_fastify.png)

Afterwards, creating an `index.js` file in your `src` directory. Add in this fastify hello world example code:

```bash
vim index.js

```

```bash

const fastify = require('fastify')({ logger: true }) 


fastify.get('/', async (request, reply) => {
  return { hello: 'Server x' }
})

const start = async () => {
  try {
    await fastify.listen({ port: 3000 })
  } catch (err) {
    fastify.log.error(err)
    process.exit(1)
  }
}
start()
```

**Note** to complete the rest of the steps, the code will need to be altered slightly. The code alteration will be demonstrated in the following steps.

Afterwards, test that your server is working locally. You can do this with the following node command:

```bash
node index.js
``` 

![step4_local_test](images/step4_local_test.png)

This will produce a url that directs to your local server (In this case it is http://127.0.0.1:5050). Type this url into your browser of choice to see if it is working properly. In this example, the server looks like this:

![step4_test_server](images/step4_test_server.png)

Once you've tested your server locally, you can move the `html` and `src` directory to both of your servers. You can do this with the `sftp` and `put` commands.

### Writing the Caddyfile

Write the Caddyfile on your local machine. 

```bash
vim Caddyfile
```

In addition to having code for a basic server block, a reverse proxy server will also be added to the Caddyfile. 

Te reverse proxy should forward localhost:5050 (http:/127.0.0.1:5050).

This allows a user who types /api after the url to load the `hello: 'Server x'` onto the browser.

It should look similar to this:

### Installing node and npm with Volta

Install node and npm with Volta. To install volta, use the following command:

```bash
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash
```

The output of the command should look like this:

![step6_install_volta](images/step6_install_volta.png)

For volta to start working you need to open a new terminal.

Before using `node`, you need to `source` the `.bashrc` after installing Volta.

```bash
source .bashrc
```

After you have done this you should be able to see two lines added to your .bashrc file. You can use `vim .bashrc` to check if it's been added to your `.bashrc` file. It should look like this:

![step6_bashrc_updated](images/step6_bashrc_updated.png)

Afterwards, install `node` with Volta. `npm` will be isntalled alongside node. Use the following command:

![step6_install_node](images/step6_install_node.png)

You can verify the installation by using the `node` command. Output should look like this:

![step6_verify_node_installation](images/step6_verify_node_installation.png)

### Writing a service file

To start the node application, you will need a service file. Create one on your local machine.

```bash
vim hello_web.service
```

In this example it is named **hello_web.service.** The service file should be configured to restart the service on failure. This can be accomplished with `Restart=on-failure` in the `[Service]` section. You will also need to make it so the service file should require a configured network. This can be accomplished with `After=network-online.target` and `Wants=network-online.target` in the `[Unit]` section.

The configuration should look similar to the screenshot below:

![step7_hello_web_vim](images/step7_hello_web_vim.png)

`User` and `Group` should be the name and group of your regular user.
`SyslogIdentifier` means "system log identifier". Information about the daemon is logged under this name in the system logs. You can also use this identifier to find the PID of your process.
`RestartSec=` configures the time to sleep before restarting a service.
`TimeoutStopSec=` configures the time to wait for each ExecStop= command, and configures the time to wait for the service itself to stop. 

In addition to creating a service file, create a `caddy.service file` on your local machine.

```bash
vim caddy.service
```

Inside your `caddy.service`, put in the following:

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Serve HTML in /var/www using caddy
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=notify
ExecStart=/usr/bin/caddy run --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
ExecReload=/usr/bin/caddy reload --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
TimeoutStopSec=5
KillMode=mixed

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target```
